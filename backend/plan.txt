Tiny real-time example — gas leak at a factory

1. Worker calls: “Strong smell of gas in Zone B near Valve 3.”
2. Aurora (instant): identifies “possible gas leak” → finds SOP for gas leaks → sends this short, actionable reply to the worker:
   “Evacuate Zone B immediately. Shut Valve 3 if safe. Switch off nearby ignition sources. Call on-site gas-repair team + fire brigade. Move to Assembly Point Alpha.”
3. Aurora also: notifies emergency responders and on-site supervisor, flags the conversation as CRITICAL, and stores the full log.
4. Supervisor sees the live thread on the admin panel and can immediately take over the call if needed.

Why this helps: worker gets clear, safe actions right away; emergency teams are alerted without delay; supervisors can intervene while everything is logged for review.

Aurora — simple summary

Elevator pitch: Aurora is a fast AI field assistant that helps frontline workers get immediate, practical guidance by voice or Telegram. If a human operator isn’t available, Aurora reads the situation, finds the right SOP or first-action, replies to the worker, and alerts emergency teams if needed — all in seconds.

How it works (very simple):
1. A worker speaks or sends a Telegram message describing a problem.
2. Aurora understands the issue, looks up the correct manual/SOP, and sends a clear next-step reply to the worker.
3. If the situation is critical (police/ambulance/fire), Aurora alerts the proper responders automatically.
4. Field supervisors see all live and past chats in a dashboard, with conversations labeled normal → critical. A supervisor can jump in and take over any call.
5. Every interaction is logged for review and compliance.
